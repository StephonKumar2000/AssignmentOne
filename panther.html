      <h5>Panther</h5>
      <p>The black panther is actually a jaguar or couger that has a mutated
      fur and skin color that can be black. The name for the reason they are black
    is called melanism. There can also be an occurence of albinism where the fur
  of the panther would be white and not black and is a rare mutation. Black panthers
have very good hearing, eyesight, and a very strong jaw. They are very smart cats.
For instance in the dark they are very stealthy like attackers. You can't see them
well or at all in the dark because of how dark their fur is.</p>
