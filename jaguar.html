      <h5>Jaguar</h5>
      <p>There are alot of big cats in the world. They are the third largest
      cat after the tiger and the lion. Like the panther, jaguars are very well
    trained swimmers. They will usually make their home near lakes and rivers since
  they are known for swimming over large rivers. They eat almost anything and
can take down almost all of their prey with ease. They hunt in the day and the night
They can take down prey that are 3 or 4 times bigger than they are due to their
very large and powerful jaws and teeth.</p>
