      <h5>Cheetah</h5>
      <p>Everyone has heard of the Cheetah as being the fastest animal on Earth.
      Cheetahs are about 112 km/h or 69.59 mph. They are as fast as how we drive on an
    everyday basis! Cheetah's hunt during the day but they aren't the most dominant hunters
  but they use their speed to their advantage against their prey and fellow predators. Cheetah's
live in groups and when they give birth they give birth to 2-8 cubs. They only live up to 17-20
years. There are not many Cheetahs left in the world. They maybe fast but they are not agressive
animals and don't even roar.</p>
